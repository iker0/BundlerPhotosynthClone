This is a Photosynth clone written in Rails that uses open-source solutions:
Bundler -- [this one](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/ "Bundler:
Structure from Motion (SfM) for Unordered Image Collections"), not the [Ruby
one](http://gembundler.com/ "Bundler: The best way to manage Ruby
applications") -- for model building, and XB-PointStream for display. It also
implements serial uploads using pure Javascript; no Flash.

Code that is not part of Bundler or XB-PointStream is licensed Creative Commons BY-NC-SA.

Currently, the Bundler code used by this project is tweaked to support more
configurable locations for output files. As a convenience, bundler_tools.tgz
contains these tweaked files (compilation and configuration in
config/bundler.yml is left as an exercise for the reader; it shouldn't be too
hard on Linux; if you'd like help on Linux or OS X, let me know.) All licenses
are as given in the software packages within:
